# Entities
 Project for definiing the db context and for adding entities to (Obviously we'd add more at a later stage in a more advanced software)
# Models
The domain models we pass for communication between Front end and back end. These are compiled (with an extension for visual studio called CS2TS (C sharp to Typsecript)) So I can have the same contract models defined on the front end for ease of use.
# Services
Business logic etc
# Unit Tests
As you'd expect, unit tests of business logic. In a proper business scenario I'd unit test the controllers too (especially as I do validation logic at that layer)
# angular app
A very simple implementation of the angular app, with events being emitted and subscribed to, forms, some basic validation, and service layers. I wasn't certain if you guys do/wanted front end unit tests or not.
UI Design is also quite basic, in a real world I'd have spinners, modals and actually nice css styling haha, but functionally it should meet the spec.
